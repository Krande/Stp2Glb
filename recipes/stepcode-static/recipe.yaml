  summary: Data Exchange with ISO 10303 (STEP) standards
  description: |
    STEPcode (formerly NIST's STEP Class Library) is used with IFC, STEP,
    and other standards that utilize the technologies of ISO10303 (STEP).
    It generates C++ and Python from EXPRESS (10303-11) schemas. The code is
    capable of reading and writing STEP Part 21 exchange files.
    It also utilizes Parts 22 and 23 (SDAI and its C++ binding).
